# ASSESSMENT 3: Behavioral Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. Use the Nugget + STAR method for each answer.

1. Tell me about a project or accomplishment youâ€™re proud of.

- Nugget: In college, I took a class called Modern Chinese Culture Through Film.
- Situation: At the end of the semester, everyone was required to make a presentation in front of the class. We could each pick our own topic, but it had to be relevant to the course subject.
- Task: Our professor had her reservations at first, but my friend and I managed to convince her to let us do a joint presentation on Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan's impact on film.
- Action: Surprisingly, there were many useful resources in the university's library. I did most of the research, and my friend organized the material and created the PowerPoint.
- Result: In the end, I don't think it was anything special, but my friend and I managed to keep it very informative and professional. The professor was impressed, especially since our topic made her worry we would not take the project seriously. It felt rewarding to know that we not only did a good job on the presentation, at least in her eyes, but also managed to subvert her initial expectations.

2. Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a high-pressure situation in your job.

- Nugget: In the Navy, I spent two years in Norfolk as an assistant weather forecaster. I worked on a team with several other forecasters and assistants.
- Situation: After about a year or so, I managed to develop my skills enough that my team trusted me to handle certain assignments as an actual forecaster. This ended up being a double-edged sword for me as I was now being relied upon to fulfill the responsibilities of both a forecaster and an assistant.
- Task: Well, one day, we were short a few forecasters. To compensate, one of the forecasters assigned me a large number of forecasts to write, many more than I was used to.
- Action: It was definitely overwhelming having to suddenly deal with such a heavy workload. At the time, I was still relatively slow at writing my forecasts. But I took a lot of pride in my work and I tried to just power through it. Our shift was 12 hours long, which is normally not an issue. But that day, with so much to do, it almost seemed as though 12 hours wouldn't be enough. It felt as though, aside from taking bathroom breaks, I never got out of my chair. I just focused on getting the forecasts out in a timely manner.
- Result: I did manage to complete all of my assignments without sacrificing quality to do so. But my chief noticed the situation and addressed the team at turnover. He reminded us that if we were feeling overwhelmed, it was okay for us to reach out and ask for help. Although I'm proud of my resilience that day, I feel as though I'd be more willing to let my supervisors know when I'm feeling overwhelmed.
