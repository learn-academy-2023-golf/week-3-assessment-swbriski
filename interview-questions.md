# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is JavaScript XML. It allows JavaScript to be written as HTML elements. JSX uses JavaScript fragments. JavaScript variables can be included in the HTML by enclosing them in curly brackets.

Researched answer: JSX uses className instead of class to modify a JSX element. This is because class is already a protected keyword in JavaScript.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn, Yet Another Resource Negotiator, is a package manager that installs and manages node modules. In addition to these node modules, it also includes a file called .gitignore.

Researched answer: Yarn installs all the dependencies listen in the package.json file. If yarn.lock is present in package.json, yarn will install the exact version listed. If yarn.lock is not present in package.json, yarn will look for the newest version of available that satisfies the constraints of package.json and install that version.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: A state value represents the current value for a variable. States can change. In React, the default state of a variable can be set using the React hook useState(). Props allow functions and variables to be used by nested components.

Researched answer: State is a data structure used by React to store data. Props can only be passed in one direction.

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: I do not know what a span tag is.

Researched answer: Div and span tags can both be used for structural and styling purposes. Div tags create block-level elements that take up the entire width of the page. Span tags are usually used to style inline content like words within a line of text.
